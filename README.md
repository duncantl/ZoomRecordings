This allows one to programmatically get meta-data about the recordings
in your zoom account and to programmatically download them.
It appears that some Zoom accounts may have an option to download  recordings in bulk, but mine
does not and I needed to download the recordings from my course (lectures and office hours).

It works, but no frills - yet!
